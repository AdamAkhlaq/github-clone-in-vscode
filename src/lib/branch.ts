// switcher button in the file-navigation header names the current branch
// unambiguously, including on the repo root where the URL omits it.
//
// A WRONG ref 404s the download, so detection is conservative: it returns a ref
// only when it's confident the switcher shows a branch, and null otherwise.
// Every caller falls back to the name-agnostic `HEAD` archive on null (see
// buildArchiveUrl), so an uncertain read degrades to "default branch" rather
// than breaking the download.
